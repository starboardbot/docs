This guide will teach you how to make an age-restricted starboard, for messages from age-restricted channels to be sent to.

<Aside type="note">
  Starboard will __NOT__ send messages from age-restricted channels to a channel that is not also marked as age-restricted.

  If your current starboard channel is marked as age-restricted, messages from both age-restricted and non-age-restricted channels can be sent there.
</Aside>


This age-restricted starboard will be created using a **channel-type-based override**. You can read up on them here:

<Steps>

1.  Create a channel-type override, for All NSFW Channels, and set the starboard:

    <CommandInput command="overrides create channel-type" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'name',
            value: 'Age Restricted Channels',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'channel-types',
            value: 'All NSFW Channels',
        }
    ]}/>
    <CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'override',
            value: 'Age Restricted Channels',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.Channel,
            name: 'starboard',
            value: "nsfw-starboard",
        },
    ]}/>

</Steps>

<Aside type="note" title="Be careful!">
  Make sure your <InlineMention name="#nsfw-starboard"/> is marked as age-restricted!
</Aside>

That's it!  Messages from all age-restricted channels will now be sent to an age-restricted starboard.
