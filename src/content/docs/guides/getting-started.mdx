import { Aside, } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import CommandInput, { OptionType } from '../../../components/CommandInput.astro';

### Setup

Creating a basic starboard configuration is as simple as running a single command:

<CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Channel,
        name: 'starboard',
        value: 'starboard',
    }
]}/>

This will set your starboard channel to `#starboard`, and use the default settings of 3 stars.

## Main Settings

Starboard is highly advanced, but has a few main settings that you'll most likely want to change.  Let's take a look at them.

### Required Stars

The first is `required-stars` which, as the name implies, is the amount of stars a message has to gain before being posted to your starboard channel.

By default, your starboard will require 3 stars.

<CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Number,
        name: 'required-stars',
        value: 5,
    }
]}/>

### Emojis

The next is `emojis` which are the emojis that can be used as starboard reactions.

<CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'emojis',
        value: '⭐ 🍣',
    }
]}/>

By default, you can have up to 2 emojis.  You can have up to 10 with [Starboard Premium](https://patreon.com/TheNoob27).
