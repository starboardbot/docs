### Optional Filters

When adding filters to your server's settings, you can mark them as **optional**.

When two or more optional filters are beside each other, only one of them has to pass to allow the message to get stars.

<Aside type="note" title="Be careful!">
    If an optional filter is by itself, it still has to pass for the message to be able to get stars.
</Aside>

##### This guide will use the following scenario:

You have 3 filters:

1. "**Cat Lover**" - a message must include the word "cat" and have 300 or more characters

2. “**Dog Lover**" - a message must include the word "dog" and have 20 or more characters

3. “**Animal Image**" - a message must include at least 1 attachment

You want to set up your server so that users must pass the third filter, and must pass either the first **or** the second filter (either be a cat or dog lover, and show proof).

<Steps>
1.  All you have to do is add the filters, ensuring you mark the mutually-dependant ones as optional:
    <CommandInput command="filter add" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'filter',
            value: 'Cat Lover',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'settings',
            value: 'Server Settings',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.Boolean,
            name: 'optional',
            value: 'True',
            highlight: true,
        },
    ]}/>
    <CommandInput command="filter add" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'filter',
            value: 'Dog Lover',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'settings',
            value: 'Server Settings',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.Boolean,
            name: 'optional',
            value: 'True',
            highlight: true,
        },
    ]}/>
    <CommandInput command="filter add" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'filter',
            value: 'Animal Image',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'settings',
            value: 'Server Settings',
        },
    ]}/>
</Steps>

That's it! Now messages need to pass the "**Animal Image**" filter, and need to either pass the "**Cat Lover**" filter or the "**Dog Lover**" filter.
