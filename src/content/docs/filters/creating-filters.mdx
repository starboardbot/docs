## What are filters?

Filters provide a way to, as the name implies, filter what messages are eligible to be starred.


There are 4 types of filters, each with their respective purpose:

1.  **Age**.  These are relative to how old the message was when it was starred.

2.  **Attachments**.  Attachment filters dictate whether attachments are required, how many are required, etc.

    <Aside type="note">
        Files, embeds, and links are all considered attachments.
    </Aside>

3.  **Content**.  Content filters control the content of the message, such as the length, or requiring certain text/patterns to be matched.

4.  **Date**.  Date filters require messages to be starred before/after certain dates.

## Creating Filters

<Steps>

1.  The first thing you need to do is to create a filter.

    Let's create an attachments filter, that requires messages to have at least **2** attachments:

    <CommandInput command="filters create attachments" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'name',
            value: 'my first attachment filter',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.Number,
            name: 'min-attachments',
            value: '2',
        },
    ]}/>

2.  So far, this filter exists but doesn't do anything since it hasn't been added to your server's settings.

    Let's change that, by adding it to your settings:

    <CommandInput command="filter add" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'filter',
            value: 'my first attachment filter',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'settings',
            value: 'Server Settings',
        },
    ]}/>

</Steps>

That's it!  Messages will now have to have at least **2** attachments in order to be starred.
