Before creating message filters, you should know of simple settings and features that aid in filtering which messages are allowed to be starred.

## Blacklist and Whitelist

You can blacklist users/roles/channels so that messages sent by users on the blacklist, with a role on the blacklist, or messages sent in channels on the blacklist, cannot be starred.
Blacklisted users also cannot add stars to messages by default.
<CommandInput command="blacklist add role" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Role,
        name: 'role',
        value: "Role1",
    }
]}/>

If you want a user/role/channel to be exempt from the blacklist, you can add them to the whitelist.
<CommandInput command="whitelist add user" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Role,
        name: 'user',
        value: "user1",
    }
]}/>

A more specific blacklist will beat a less specific whitelist. This means that if <InlineMention name="@everyone"/> is blacklisted but <InlineMention name="@user1"/> is whitelisted, the user is whitelisted.
But if <InlineMention name="@user1"/> is blacklisted and <InlineMention name="@everyone"/> is whitelisted, the user is still blacklisted, as targetting the user is more specific.


## Filtering Settings

There are also a few simple settings related to filtering messages, that you should know about.

### Self Stars

When **Self Stars** is disabled, users won't be allowed to star their own messages.

<CommandInput command="settings edit filtering" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Boolean,
        name: 'self-stars',
        value: "False",
    }
]}/>

This is disabled by default.

### Filter Bots

When **Filter Bots** is enabled, users won't be allowed to star messages sent by bots.

<CommandInput command="settings edit filtering" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Boolean,
        name: 'filter-bots',
        value: "True",
    }
]}/>

This is disabled by default.

### Filter Blacklisted Users

You can blacklist users so they can't star messages or have their messages on the starboard.
The **Filter Blacklisted Users** setting modifies this behaviour regarding blacklisted users.

You have 3 options:
- filter blacklisted authors, meaning no one can star messages sent by blacklisted users
- filter blacklisted reactors, meaning blacklisted users can't star messages by anyone
- filter both blacklisted authors & reactors, meaning blacklisted users can't star messages or have their messages on the starboard. This is the default behaviour.

To change this behaviour, edit the **Filter Blacklisted Users** setting.

<CommandInput command="settings edit filtering" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'filter-blacklisted-users',
        value: "Filter Both (Reactors & Message Authors)",
    }
]}/>

### Remove Invalid Reactions

As the name implies, enabling this setting causes invalid reactions to be removed, instead of just being ignored.

<CommandInput command="settings edit filtering" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Boolean,
        name: 'remove-invalid-reactions',
        value: "False",
    }
]}/>

Invalid reactions include:
- reacting on your own message when **Self Stars** is disabled
- reactions by blacklisted users
- reacting to a message sent by a user that is blacklisted
- reacting on a bot's message when **Filter Bots** is enabled
- reactions in a blacklisted channel
- **reacting to a message that doesn't pass message filters**

This is enabled by default.
