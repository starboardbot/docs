You can view all the settings starboard has to offer with the following command:
<CommandInput command="settings view" />
The command to change a setting will be found in the corresponding category the setting is listed in.
For example, the command to change **Sync Message Edits** (found in the Miscellaneous category), is  `/settings edit misc`.

Starboard has a few more advanced settings that you can customise.


### Filter Blacklisted Users

You can blacklist users so they can't star messages or have their messages on the starboard.
This setting modifies this behaviour regarding blacklisted users.

You have 3 options:
- filter blacklisted authors, meaning no-one can star messages sent by blacklisted users
- filter blacklisted reactors, meaning blacklisted users can't star messages by anyone
- filter both blacklisted authors & reactors, meaning blacklisted users can't star messages or have their messages on the starboard. This is default behaviour.

To change this behaviour, edit the **Filter Blacklisted Users** setting.

<CommandInput command="settings edit filtering" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'filter-blacklisted-users',
        value: "Filter Both (Reactors & Message Authors)",
    }
]}/>

### Starboard React

By default, the bot reacts to every starboard message it posts, to offer users a shortcut — users can either react on the starboard message to add a star, or go and find the original message to add a star. This is recommended behaviour.

To change this behaviour, edit the **Starboard React** setting.

<CommandInput command="settings edit misc" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'starboard-react',
        value: "Upvote & Downvote Emojis",
    }
]}/>

### Sync Message Deletes

When this setting is enabled, if a message that has reposted to the starboard gets deleted, its corresponding starboard message will be deleted also.

<CommandInput command="settings edit misc" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Boolean,
        name: 'sync-message-deletes',
        value: 'False',
    }
]}/>

This is disabled by default.

### Sync Message Edits

When this setting is enabled, starboard messages will be updated whenever the original message is edited, to match the content.

<CommandInput command="settings edit misc" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Boolean,
        name: 'sync-message-edits',
        value: 'True',
    }
]}/>

This is disabled by default.

### When Deleted

This setting gives you the option to dictate what happens when a starboard message is deleted.

You have 4 options:
- do nothing - users can star the message again to get it back on the starboard
- repost the starboard message immediately
- freeze the starred message so it can't get any more stars
- trash (and freeze) the starred message

<CommandInput command="settings edit misc" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'when-deleted',
        value: "Do Nothing",
    }
]}/>

By default, nothing happens when a starboard message is deleted.
