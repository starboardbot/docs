You can view all the settings Starboard has to offer with the following command:
<CommandInput command="settings view" />
The command to change a setting will be found in the corresponding category the setting is listed in.
For example, the command to change **Self Stars** (found in the Filtering category), is  `/settings edit filtering`.

Try having a look through all the `/settings edit` sub-commands and their options to quickly find settings you might want to set.
Starboard has a few basic settings that you'll most likely want to know about:


### Starboard

**Starboard** is the most important setting — this is where all starred messages go.

<CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Channel,
        name: 'starboard',
        value: 'starboard',
    }
]}/>
<Aside type="tip">
    The bot will not listen to messages for reactions if there's no starboard channel set.
</Aside>

### Required Stars

**Required Stars**, as the name implies, is the amount of stars a message has to gain before being posted to your starboard channel.

<CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Number,
        name: 'required-stars',
        value: 5,
    }
]}/>

By default, your starboard will require 3 stars.

### Required Stars To Remove

Alongside the previous setting, **Required Stars To Remove** dictates the number of stars a starboard message must fall to before being removed from the starboard.

<CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Number,
        name: 'required-stars-to-remove',
        value: 3,
    }
]}/>

By default, messages will be removed if they fall to 2 stars.


### Emojis

The **Emojis** setting is the emojis that can be used to add stars to messages — a message needs [**Required Stars**] many reactions of these emojis to reach the starboard.

<CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'emojis',
        value: '⭐ 🍣',
    }
]}/>

By default, you can have up to 2 emojis.  You can have up to 10 with <ExternalLink type={LinkType.Premium}/>.

### Self Stars

When **Self Stars** is disabled, users won't be allowed to star their own messages.

<CommandInput command="settings edit filtering" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Boolean,
        name: 'self-stars',
        value: "False",
    }
]}/>

This is disabled by default.

### Remove Invalid Reactions

As the name implies, enabling this setting causes invalid reactions to be removed, instead of just being ignored.

<CommandInput command="settings edit filtering" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Boolean,
        name: 'remove-invalid-reactions',
        value: "False",
    }
]}/>

Invalid reactions include:
- reacting on your own message when **Self Stars** is disabled
- reactions by blacklisted users
- reacting to a message sent by a user that is blacklisted
- reacting on a bot's message when **Filter Bots** is enabled
- reactions in a blacklisted channel
- reacting to a message that doesn't pass message filters

This is enabled by default.
