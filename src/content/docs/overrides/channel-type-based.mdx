Channel-type-based overrides are useful when you want to change specific settings based on the type of channel.

##### This guide will use the following scenario:

You have your Server Settings set to send messages to the starboard at 10 stars, but Text-in-Voice channels aren't as active so you want to set the required amount to 2 for them instead.

<Steps>

1.  The first thing you need to do is create an override for all voice channels:

    <CommandInput command="overrides create channel-type" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'name',
            value: 'Voice Channels',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'channel-types',
            value: 'All Voice/Stage Channels',
        }
    ]}/>

2.  Next, you'll need to change the settings for the override you've just created:

    <CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'override',
            value: 'Voice Channels',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.Number,
            name: 'required-stars',
            value: 2,
        },
    ]}/>

</Steps>

That's it!  Messages in all voice channels will now require only 2 stars.
