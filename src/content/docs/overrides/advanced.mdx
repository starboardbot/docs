More ambitious users might wish to create more complicated setups with their overrides.
This guide will walk you through the different, more advanced concepts to do with overrides.

## Multiple Overrides
When you have multiple overrides that can apply at a time, you may wonder which way they'll be applied.
<Aside>
    Although multiple different overrides can apply to the same channel, role, or emoji, a message can only be posted to one starboard channel at a time.
    Overrides that have the **Starboard** setting set will simply override other **Starboard** setting values.
</Aside>

**The overrides that are applied last are the most prioritised as their settings and modifications are kept.** The overrides that are applied first may have modifications overridden by the next override.

Overrides are applied as follows:
1. **custom priority value** - overrides with higher priority values are applied last
2. if the custom priority values are the same, then the **override type** is checked:
    1. Channel-type-based overrides are applied first,
    2. Then channel-based overrides,
    3. Then role-based overrides,
    4. And lastly, emoji-based overrides are applied.
3. if the types are the same, then the **creation date** is checked. Newer overrides are applied last.

You can give overrides custom priority values with the `priority` option:
<CommandInput command="overrides create channel" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'name',
        value: 'My prioritised override',
    },
    {
        type: OptionType.Channel,
        name: 'channels',
        value: 'channel-1 channel-2',
        multiple: true,
    },
    {
        type: OptionType.Number,
        name: 'priority',
        value: '10',
        highlight: true,
    },
]}/>
Overrides have a default custom priority value of 0.

### Example Setup
Let's say you have the following setup:
- "Channel Override (A)" for <InlineMention name="#channel-1"/>, <InlineMention name="#channel-2"/> with priority value 1
- "Role Override (B)" for <InlineMention name="@Role 1"/>
- "Channel Override 2 (C)" for <InlineMention name="#channel-1"/>
- "Role Override 2 (D)" from <InlineMention name="@Role 1"/>, <InlineMention name="@Role 2"/>
- "Channel Override 3 (E)" for <InlineMention name="#channel-2"/> with priority value 2
- "ChannelType Override (F)" for all text/announcement channels

If a message is starred in <InlineMention name="#channel-1"/> sent by a user with just the <InlineMention name="@Role 1"/> role, the following overrides will be applied in the following order:
1. "ChannelType Override (F)" (due to override type),
1. then "Channel Override 2 (C)", (due to override type)
1. then "Role Override (B)", (due to override type)
1. then "Role Override 2 (D)", (due to override type, created after previous role override)
1. then lastly "Channel Override (A)". (due to custom priority value of 1)

If a message is starred in <InlineMention name="#channel-2"/> sent by a user with just the <InlineMention name="@Role 1"/> role, the following overrides will be applied in the following order:
1. "ChannelType Override (F)" (due to override type),
1. then "Role Override (B)", (due to override type)
1. then "Role Override 2 (D)", (due to override type, created after previous role override)
1. then "Channel Override (A)", (due to custom priority value of 1)
1. then lastly "Channel Override 3 (E)" (due to custom priority value of 2)


## Inheriting From Other Overrides
By default, overrides inherit from the server settings. You can make an override inherit from other overrides instead, in case you have a big override with a lot of modifications made, and you want to copy those modifications to another override.

If an override inherits from another override, and multiple overrides are made (like in the scenarios above), all the override-specific inherited modifications are applied before the next overrides, then finally the server settings.

Say if you have the following setup:
- "Channel Override (A)" for <InlineMention name="#channel-1"/>
- "Channel Override 2 (B)" for <InlineMention name="#channel-1"/>, <InlineMention name="#channel-2"/>
- "Role Override (C)" for <InlineMention name="@Role 1"/> that inherits from "Channel Override (A)"
- "Role Override 2 (D)" from <InlineMention name="@Role 1"/>, <InlineMention name="@Role 2"/>

If a message is starred in <InlineMention name="#channel-2"/> sent by a user with just the <InlineMention name="@Role 1"/> role, settings will be set in the following order:
1. the server settings, as the base
1. the settings of "Channel Override (A)"
1. then the settings of "Channel Override 2 (B)"
1. then the settings of "Role Override (C)", *after* the settings of "Channel Override (A)" (again)
1. lastly, the settings of "Role Override 2 (D)"

You can make overrides inherit from other overrides with the `inherit-from` option:
<CommandInput command="overrides create channel" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'name',
        value: 'My inherited override',
    },
    {
        type: OptionType.Channel,
        name: 'channels',
        value: 'channel-1 channel-2',
        multiple: true,
    },
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'inherit-from',
        value: 'Some override with a LOT of changed settings',
        highlight: true,
    },
