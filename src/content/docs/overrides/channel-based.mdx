Channel-based overrides are useful when you want to change specific settings for a group of channels.

##### This guide will use the following scenario:

You have your Server Settings set to use the ⭐ emoji, but you want to use the 🎨 emoji for your art channels.

<Steps>

1.  The first thing you need to do is create an override for the art channels

    <CommandInput command="overrides create channel" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'name',
            value: 'art channel override',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.Channel,
            name: 'channels',
            value: 'art-share art-discussion',
            multiple: true,
        }
    ]}/>

2.  Next, you need to change the settings for the override you just created

    <CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'override',
            value: 'art channel override',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'emojis',
            value: '🎨',
        },
    ]}/>

</Steps>

That's it!  Messages in the art channels will now use the 🎨 emoji.
