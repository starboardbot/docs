Role-based overrides are useful when you want to change specific settings based on the roles the author of the starred message has.

<Aside type="note">
    The roles that the reactor (the person adding the star) has, have no effect on which role-based overrides are applied and which settings are used.

##### This guide will use the following scenario:

You have your Server Settings set to send messages to <InlineMention name="#starboard"/> after 7 stars, but members with the <InlineMention name="@Prestigious"/> role are special, they get their messages sent to <InlineMention name="#prestigious-starboard"/> after 3 stars.

<Steps>

1.  The first thing you need to do is create an override for the <InlineMention name="@Prestigious"/> role:

    <CommandInput command="overrides create role" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'name',
            value: 'Prestigious',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.Role,
            name: 'roles',
            value: 'Prestigious',
        }
    ]}/>

    <Aside type="tip">
        If you want this role-based override to only apply in a set of channels and not in all channels, you can provide a list of channels:
        <CommandInput command="overrides create role" options={[
            {
                type: OptionType.String,
                name: 'name',
                value: 'Prestigious',
            },
            {
                type: OptionType.Role,
                name: 'roles',
                value: 'Prestigious',
            },
            {
                type: OptionType.Channel,
                name: 'channels',
                value: 'general prestigious-chat-1 prestigious-chat-2',
                multiple: true,
                highlight: true,
            }
        ]}/>
    </Aside>

2.  Next, you'll need to change the settings for the override you've just created:

    <CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'override',
            value: 'Prestigious',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.Channel,
            name: 'starboard',
            value: "prestigious-starboard",
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.Number,
            name: 'required-stars',
            value: 3,
        },
    ]}/>

</Steps>

That's it!  Messages by members with the <InlineMention name="@Prestigious"/> role will now be sent to <InlineMention name="#prestigious-starboard"/> after getting 3 stars.
