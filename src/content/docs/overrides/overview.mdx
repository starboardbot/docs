Starboard supports several types of overrides, based on a variety of factors:

1.  **Channel-based**.  These apply to specific channels.

2.  **Channel-type-based**.  These apply to specific *types* of channels, such as text channels, age-restricted channels, etc.

3.  **Role-based**.  These apply when the message author has specific roles.

4.  **Emoji-based**.  These apply when specific emojis are used.


## What are overrides?

Overrides are a way to have specific settings applied only in specific contexts, such as when starring messages in a specific channel.
For example, you could allow self stars server-wide by enabling the **Self Stars** setting, but then create an override for a specific role or channel that disallows self stars by disabling the **Self Stars** setting on the override.

Overrides work like the server settings and can have their own display tiers, blacklists, whitelists, message filters, and of course, the individual settings themselves.

## Inheriting From Server Settings

Overrides inhert everything from the server settings. This means that if you change a setting on the server settings, you don't have to change the setting on the override as well.

<Aside type="tip">
    Overrides work like Discord channel permissions. For example - on Discord, if `@everyone` cannot add reactions, but the channel permissions for a channel grants `@Role` the Add Reactions permission, users with that role can add reactions in that channel.

Modifications on overrides override modifications on the server settings, but in a select few scenarios the modifications are instead added onto the modifications on the server settings.

### Blacklists and Whitelists
Anything you add to the blacklist or whitelist on an override will simply add on to the existing blacklist/whitelist of the server settings. (Your server settings won't be modified.)
So, if `@user1` and `@Role 1` is blacklisted, and on an override for `#channel-1` you have `@user2` blacklisted, it means that for `#channel-1` there is `@user1`, `@Role 1`, and `@user2` on the blacklist.

Blacklists and whitelists are added together before users/channels are checked to see if they are blacklisted or not.
This means that if `@user1` is whitelisted on the server settings, adding `@user1` to the blacklist on an override won't change anything - it's like having `@user1` on the blacklist and the whitelist on the server settings.

### Display Tiers
If you create a display tier for an override, you've now separated display tiers for the override from the display tiers for the server settings, and fully overriden the display tiers that are used.

So, you can use a set of display tiers for the server settings but a different set for an override.

### Filters
Like blacklists and whitelists, anything you add to the list of filters on an override will simply add on to the existing list of filters on the server settings. (Your server settings won't be modified.)

So, if your filters are set up as follows:
- Server Settings
    - Filter 1
    - Filter 2
- Override for `#channel-1`
    - Filter 3

It means a message in `#channel-1` must pass Filter 1, Filter 2, and Filter 3 in order to be starred, but a message elsewhere only has to pass Filter 1 and Filter 2.
