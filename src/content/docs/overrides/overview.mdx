Starboard supports several types of overrides, based on a variety of factors:

1.  **Channel-based**.  These apply to specific channels.

2.  **Channel-type-based**.  These apply to specific *types* of channels, such as text channels, age-restricted channels, etc.

3.  **Emoji-based**.  These apply when specific emojis are used.

4.  **Role-based**.  These apply when the message author has specific roles.
