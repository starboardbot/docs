### The Leaderboard Commands
As more and more messages get starred in your server, the bot records a set of information so it can create a leaderboard for your users.

There are 3 types of basic server leaderboards:

1. **Total Stars** - users with the most stars gained
    <Aside type="note">
        Self-stars are not recorded on this leaderboard.
    </Aside>
2. **Times On Starboard** - users with the most times on the starboard
3. **Most Starred Message** - users with the most stars on a message

<Aside type="note">
    Bots are always recorded and displayed on the leaderboard, even if the **Filter Bots** setting is enabled.
</Aside>

### The Stats Commands
The <InlineMention name="/stats" /> commands aren't based on leaderboard data, but rather calculations based on the actual starred messages themselves.

This means that they cannot be reset or augmented, and the stats displayed in these commands include self-stars.
