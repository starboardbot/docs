As we know, with overrides you can create advanced setups, such as specific settings for an art category.
<LinkCard title="Overrides" href="../../overrides/overview" />
But the server leaderboard always show stats based on all data recorded across the server.
Custom Leaderboards are based on a subset of leaderboard data.

## Custom Leaderboard Stats
Custom leaderboards work by creating custom leaderboard stats, and only recording them when specific overrides are applied.

Right now, custom leaderboard stats can be based off one of the following stats:
- Total Stars (`upvotes - downvotes`)
- Total Upvotes
- Total Downvotes
- Times On Starboard
- Most Starred Message

## Creating Custom Leaderboards
Let's use the following scenario:

You have a channel-based override **Art** that applies to 5 art related channels. You run art competitions often and want to see leaderboards based on only the amount of stars gotten in these art channels.

<Steps>

1.  The first thing you need to do is to create the custom leaderboard stat.

    <CommandInput command="custom-leaderboard create" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'name',
            value: 'Art Stars',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'based-on',
            value: 'Total Stars',
        },
    ]}/>

    <Aside type="tip">
        If you want your custom leaderboard to display entries in a certain way, you can use the `display` option.
        <CommandInput command="custom-leaderboard create" options={[
            {
                type: OptionType.String,
                name: 'name',
                value: 'Art Stars',
            },
            {
                type: OptionType.String,
                name: 'based-on',
                value: 'Total Stars',
            },
            {
                type: OptionType.String,
                name: 'display',
                value: '# art stars',
                highlight: true,
            },
        ]}/>
        In the above example, entries will be displayed as `# art stars` — `50 art stars`, `1,000 art stars` etc.
    </Aside>

2.  So far, this custom leaderboard stat exists but isn't yet being recorded as it hasn't been added to the override you want it to function on.

    We want this stat to be recorded for the art channels, so let's add it to the **Art** override.

    <CommandInput command="custom-leaderboard add" options={[
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'stat',
            value: 'Art Stars',
        },
        {
            type: OptionType.String,
            name: 'override',
            value: 'Art',
        },
    ]}/>

</Steps>

That's it! Now, stars recorded in any of the art channels will add to the custom **Art Stars** stat.
Now, if users want to view the custom **Art Stars** leaderboard, they can run the following command:
<CommandInput command="leaderboard custom" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'stat',
        value: 'Art Stars',
    },
]}/>


## Reward Roles
You can also make reward roles with requirements based on custom leaderboard stats!

For example, to make it so that in order to get a specific role, a user must get a certain number of art stars (from the example above), you can run the following command:
<CommandInput command="rewardroles create" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Role,
        name: 'role',
        value: 'Artistic Superstars',
    },
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'type',
        value: 'Custom: Art Stars',
    },
    {
        type: OptionType.Number,
        name: 'required',
        value: '50',
    },
]}/>
