The Hall of Fame is similar to the leaderboard, except that it's a list of messages that were picked out by various moderators.
Like server pins and the starboard itself, they allow moderators to once again highlight messages that "belong in a museum" - the best messages on the server.
<CommandInput command="hall-of-fame" />

To add a message to the Hall of Fame, you can either run the following command:
<CommandInput command="mod hall-of-fame add" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Message,
        name: 'starred-message',
    },
]}/>

Or you can use the <InlineMention name="Add to Hall of Fame" /> context menu command on the message you want to add.

<Aside type="note">
    The Hall of Fame is not a starboard, and the <InlineMention name="Add to Hall of Fame" /> context menu command won't post the message to the starboard.

    If you wish to post a message to the starboard, you can use the <InlineMention name="Force to Starboard" /> context menu command instead.
