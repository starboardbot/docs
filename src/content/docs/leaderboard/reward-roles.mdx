Reward roles are a fun way to reward users for getting their messages starred.

They are roles that are given to users after reaching a certain requirement, such as:
1. **Total Stars** - reward roles based on the stars users have
2. **Most Starred Message** - reward roles based on the user's most starred message
3. **Times On Starboard** - reward roles based on how many times users have been on the starboard
4. **Times On Hall Of Fame** - reward roles based on how many times users have gotten on the Hall Of Fame

## Creating Reward Roles
To create a reward role, you just need to run one command:
<CommandInput command="rewardroles create" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Role,
        name: 'role',
        value: 'Superstars',
    },
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'type',
        value: 'Total Stars',
    },
    {
        type: OptionType.Number,
        name: 'required',
        value: '100',
    },
]}/>
This created a reward role <InlineMention name="@Superstars" /> that is awarded to users after obtaining **100** stars in total.

### Multiple Requirements
If you create the same reward role again but with a different type, you can allow users to achieve either one of those requirements in order to get the role.
<CommandInput command="rewardroles create" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Role,
        name: 'role',
        value: 'Superstars',
    },
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'type',
        value: 'Times On Starboard',
    },
    {
        type: OptionType.Number,
        name: 'required',
        value: '20',
    },
]}/>
Now, the reward role <InlineMention name="@Superstars" /> is awarded to users after they either obtain **100** stars in total or get on the starboard **20** times.

## Removing Old Reward Roles
By default, users get to keep the old reward roles they obtain. If you wish to change this behaviour, disable the **Keep Old Reward Roles** setting.
<CommandInput command="settings edit misc" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Boolean,
        name: 'keep-old-reward-roles',
        value: 'False',
    }
]}/>
