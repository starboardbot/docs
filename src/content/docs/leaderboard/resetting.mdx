There are a few leaderboard commands for moderators to manage the leaderboard for the server.
These can be found alongside other moderator commands for managing starred messages â€” <InlineMention name="/mod" />.

## Removing Individual Users
When a member leaves the server, they aren't automatically removed off the leaderboard.

To reset a user's leaderboard data and remove them from all leaderboards, you can run the following command:
<CommandInput command="mod leaderboard reset-user" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Role,
        name: 'user',
        value: 'deleted-user',
    }
]}/>

## Resetting The Whole Leaderboard
To reset all leaderboards entirely, you can run the following command:
<CommandInput command="mod leaderboard reset" />

### Timed Resets
If you wish, you can schedule timed resets.
You can make it so that every set period of time, all of the leaderboards are reset. This is useful if you run monthly competitions in your server, for example.

You can either schedule a reset every certain number of days:
<CommandInput command="mod leaderboard auto-reset" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Number,
        name: 'days',
        value: '7',
    }
]}/>
Or can schedule a reset on a certain date of the month:
<CommandInput command="mod leaderboard auto-reset" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Number,
        name: 'date-of-month',
        value: '1',
    }
]}/>
