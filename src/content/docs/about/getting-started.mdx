import { Aside, } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import CommandInput, { OptionType } from '../../../components/CommandInput.astro';
import ExternalLink, { LinkType } from '../../../components/ExternalLink.astro';
import InlineMention from '../../../components/InlineMention.astro';

### Setup

Creating a basic starboard configuration is as simple as running a single command:

<CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Channel,
        name: 'starboard',
        value: 'starboard',
    }
]}/>

This will set your starboard channel to <InlineMention name="#starboard"/>, and use the default settings of 3 stars. By default, users can't star their own messages, and their reactions will be removed if they attempt to do so.

## Main Settings
Starboard is highly advanced, but has a few main settings that you'll most likely want to change.


#### Required Stars

The first is **Required Stars** which, as the name implies, is the amount of stars a message has to gain before being posted to your starboard channel.

By default, your starboard will require 3 stars.

<CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Number,
        name: 'required-stars',
        value: 5,
    }
]}/>

#### Emojis

The next is **Emojis** which are the emojis that can be used to add stars to messages — a message needs [**Required Stars**] many reactions of these emojis to reach the starboard.

<CommandInput command="settings edit main" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.String,
        name: 'emojis',
        value: '⭐ 🍣',
    }
]}/>

By default, you can have up to 2 emojis.  You can have up to 10 with <ExternalLink type={LinkType.Premium}/>.

#### Self Stars

Lastly, you might want to take a look at **Self Stars**. When disabled, users won't be allowed to star their own messages.

<CommandInput command="settings edit filtering" options={[
    {
        type: OptionType.Boolean,
        name: 'self-stars',
        value: "False",
    }
]}/>

This is disabled by default.
