import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import CommandInput, { OptionType } from '../../../components/CommandInput.astro';
import ExternalLink, { LinkType } from '../../../components/ExternalLink.astro';

There are a few reasons why a message might not be allowed to be put on the starboard, based on your setup.

Make sure you already have the bot set up:
<LinkCard title="Getting Started" href="../../about/getting-started"/>


### Debug
All you need to do is run the debug command with a link to the message:
<CommandInput command="mod debug" options={[
    {
        name: 'message',
        type: OptionType.Message,
    }
]}/>

If the debug command tells you there's nothing wrong with the message, it should be able to get stars.

If the starred message already has stars and should be on the starboard but isn't, try checking how many stars the message has:
<CommandInput command="mod info" options={[
    {
        name: 'starred-message',
        type: OptionType.Message,
    }
]}/>

If the number of stars the bot says the message has seems to be inaccurate, you can try recounting the reactions:
<CommandInput command="mod recount" options={[
    {
        name: 'starred-message',
        type: OptionType.Message,
    }
]}/>
If the number is still inaccurate, it probably means that the other reactors are bots or are blacklisted.
