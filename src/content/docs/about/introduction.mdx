Starboard is Discord's first advanced starboard bot, with a massive amount of customisable features and settings. This bot is one of the best starboard bots you could ever ask for.

### What is a starboard?

A simple explanation as old as time is: **A starboard is like democratic pins.**

A starboard allows users to react to a message with ⭐️ and copy the message over to a <InlineMention name="#starboard"/> channel once it gets enough ⭐️'s. Unlike pinned messages, there's no limit to how many messages can be starred!

### What can Starboard do?

Starboard aims to provide a starboard feature in the most fun and customisable way possible. This bot offers:

- configuring the star emoji
- message filters
- blacklists and whitelists
- channel-specific settings
- role-specific settings
- emoji-specific settings
- multiple starboards categorised by channel/role/emoji
- user and message leaderboards
- reward roles awarded after earning a certain amount of stars or after being on the starboard a certain amount of times
- locking messages to the starboard, freezing starboard messages, trashing messages
- browsing random starred messages
- server-specific user stats and worldwide user stats

...and so much more!

You can invite the bot <ExternalLink type={LinkType.Invite}>here</ExternalLink>.


### Getting Started
Starboard offers more ambitious users the ability to create advanced setups, but also offers simple setups for new users, so don't over-complicate things for yourself!
